# LOLTRACKER

LOLTRACKER is an application that consumes an API for the video game League Of Legends from a repository. The primary focus is on API consumption and frontend development using various styling techniques. This project utilizes data from [LoL_DDragon repository](https://github.com/InFinity54/LoL_DDragon) to provide real-time information about League of Legends champions, skins, lore, and more.

## Features

- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with the [LoL_DDragon API](https://github.com/InFinity54/LoL_DDragon) for retrieving champion data.
  
- **Frontend Development**: Implemented using modern frontend technologies to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

- **Styling**: Utilizes CSS and possibly frameworks like Bootstrap for styling components and ensuring a consistent design language.

- **Real-time Updates**: Ensures that users have access to the latest champion data and updates as provided by the API.
